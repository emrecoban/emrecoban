## Hi there! 👋

![emrecobanBanner](banner.png)

My name's Emre. I have recently completed a master's in the Department of CEIT at Amasya University 🇹🇷. My master thesis is focused on computational thinking 🔭. During the thesis term I try to develop the web app, which is a reliable and valid to measure high school students' computational thinking skills 🔬. Also I make scientific studies on computer science education 🔍.
