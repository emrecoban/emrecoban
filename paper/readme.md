### Abstract

This article examines the role and limitations of artificial intelligence (AI)-based feedback tools in education. In this study, the impacts of AI-supported feedback systems on students' attitudes, motivation, and academic performance in programming courses were investigated. The study employed a mixed-method research approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative methods. The research was conducted using a quasi-experimental design with pretest-posttest control groups on a sample of 44 students. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the experimental group, which received AI-assisted feedback. The control group received traditional teacher feedback. The research investigates whether AI-supported feedback is more effective than traditional methods in improving academic success, how it affects students' motivation and attitudes, and student perceptions of these systems. The findings indicate that AI-assisted feedback is as effective as traditional methods in terms of academic achievement, though it may have a limited impact on motivation.  While students generally responded positively to AI-supported feedback, they stated that the system should provide more personalized and detailed feedback. This study can be considered an important step towards understanding the role of AI-supported feedback systems in education.
